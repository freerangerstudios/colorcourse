# Color Course  
Color Course is a challenging 2D platformer with a twist: your character can only touch blocks in the same color as himself! Make your way through the world of colors, get past all obstacles such as ghosts, death blocks, or even moving  spike balls, complete all levels and defeat the boss. Good luck!
